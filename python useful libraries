Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of packages that I often use:

Pandas[1] for data loading, cleaning, and quick exploration
Numpy[2] for (n-dimensional) array manipulation
Statsmodels[3] for statistical modelling
Scikit-learn[4] for (genera purpose) machine learning
Keras[5] for deep learning models
XGBoost[6] for gradient boosted trees
Matplotlib[7] for visualisation
Seaborn[8] for statistical visualisation
Bokeh[9] for interactive visualisation
Jupyter[10] notebook for prototyping
Ipython[11] for quicker prototyping
Dask[12] for distributed and out-of-core data manipulation
(Mini)Conda[13] for package and environment management
