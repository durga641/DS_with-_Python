disjoints : the events cant happen simultaneously 
eg : 5 and 3 cant get when a die is thrown

independent events : probability of one event wont impact the probability of other 

in that p(A ^ B ) =p(A) * p(B) 

dependent events : first event will change the probability of second evevnt

Mutually exclusive and exhaustive events :

Mutually exclusive events are those events where two events cannot happen together.

The easiest example to understand this is the toss of a coin. Getting a head and a tail are mutually exclusive because we can either get heads
 or tails but never both at the same in a single coin toss.

A set of events is collectively exhaustive when the set should contain all the possible outcomes of the experiment.
 One of the events from the list must occur for sure when the experiment is performed.
 
 find the difference between disjoint and mutually exclusive events?
